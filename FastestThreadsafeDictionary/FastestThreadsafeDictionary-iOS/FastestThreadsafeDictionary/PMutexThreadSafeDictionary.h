/*
 * Idea is:
 * Use separated lock for read and write
 * So, read operation is seemly lockless
 * Only lock when read/write, write/write concurrently.
 *
 * But currently, i can't find OSAtomic operation like that: compare a to value x, set b to value y. So there are no absolute safe solution -> use lock for all read/write operation
 * At least 10x faster than TSMutableDictionary
